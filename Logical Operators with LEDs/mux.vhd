-- Code for mux component. The information on this sub-block will transfer to the
-- LogicalStep_Lab2_top.vhd file and will allow us to choose an appropriate output depending on the pb(3)
-- push button inputs. The output will either be DIN1 or DIN2, with are 8-bit logic vectors.
-- It is used in two instances in the top vhd fileâ€”one to choose between the concatenated sum and the
-- concatenated two inputs, and the other to choose between the concatenated output of the logic sub-block
-- and the concatenated sum.
